• Surcharge programs
Fully customizable fee structures:
• Qualified / non-qualified interchange
• Card brand and network fees
• Per-item transaction fees
• Monthly, one-time, and miscellaneous fees
• Our internal device costs. (Clover POS and Payment)
• Dynamic cost comparison and savings calculations
• Visual charts and graphs showing savings across multiple timeframes:
• Daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly
• Admin-controlled configuration for pricing rules, devices, fees, and user permissions
• Secure role-based access control (admin vs agents)
• Client-ready PDF output with branded summaries and required disclaimers

Security is a top priority. The system must follow best practices for:
• Secure authentication (strong auth, MFA if applicable)
• Encrypted data at rest and in transit
• Strict access boundaries between users
• Secure handling of uploaded PDFs and generated reports

This project requires someone comfortable with:
• Complex business logic
